## Image Optimization Tips

- Use PNG format for logos (supports transparency)
- Optimize file size while maintaining quality
- Ensure logos are readable at different sizes
- Consider creating multiple sizes for different use cases

## Current Implementation

The website is configured to use:
- `/logo.png` for navigation and footer logos
- `/heroLogo.png` for the hero section logo

Make sure these files are placed directly in the `/public` directory for Next.js to serve them correctly.
